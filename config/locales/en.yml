      title: "Privacy Policy"
      intro: "This policy details how Recipy (\"Platform\", \"we\") collects, uses, protects, and transfers personal data of users (\"you\"). It is drafted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\"GDPR\") and applicable Romanian legislation."
      principles:
        title: "1. Processing Principles"
        p1: "We process data only on legal grounds, in a fair and transparent manner. For each stage, we explain the purpose, duration, and legal basis so you can make informed decisions."
        p2: "Data is collected strictly for Recipy's functionalities, for the execution of the contract with the user, and for compliance with legal obligations. We do not collect information that is not necessary for the platform's operation."
        p3: "We ensure the accuracy and updating of information through account editing mechanisms and by responding to your requests. We keep data only as long as needed to provide services or for legally required periods."
        p4: "Data integrity and confidentiality are protected through TLS encryption, AWS infrastructure located in the EU, and recurring security audits."
      data_collected:
        title: "2. Data Collected"
        p1: "Identification data (name, username, email address, avatar) are necessary for authentication and profile personalization. In the case of authentication through Google or Apple, we receive only the information strictly necessary to complete the process."
        p2: "Technical data (IP address, device type, preferred language, session identifiers) are used to deliver the interface optimally and to protect the service against unauthorized access."
        p3: "Content published by you – recipes, comments, ratings, messages – is stored to support the platform's social functions. We also keep logs and security tokens for audit and incident detection."

        p3: "Commercial communications or newsletters are sent only after obtaining explicit consent and can be stopped from any received message."
        p4: "Legal obligations (responses to authorities, tax records) justify additional processing under art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Anonymized statistical analyses and product tests are conducted based on the operator's legitimate interest."
      sharing:
        title: "4. Transfer and Disclosure"
        p1: "We do not sell or rent personal data. Information is shared only with contractual providers (AWS, email services, monitoring solutions) that offer adequate security guarantees and sign processing agreements (DPA)."
